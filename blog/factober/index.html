<h1 style="text-decoration:underline;">Factober</h1>
<p>So it's October, and not only it is the month of Oktoberfest, but also that of Inktober.
The concept of Inktober is the following: there is an official list of words - one per day - (although anyone can create its own) and artists who want to can make a drawing about this word. The idea is to force themselves to draw each day to improve their skills (and surely also for fun).</p>

</figure>
<p>I don't know how to draw. However, I do like science and learning stuff. Also, I need to practice writing for my upcoming Ph.D.
Thus I came up with an idea: Factober.</p>
<p>I will every day and for each word present a fact or answer a question related to it, in the style of scientific writing.<br />
Note that I am a physics student and because of the diversity of words, I may find myself writing about things I am learning on-the-fly and thus may contain some inaccuracies.<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Moreover, there is a non-zero probability that I give up at some point.</span></p>

<h3>1. Dream</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">Will Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</div>
<p>Sleep have been shown to be essential for the brain to function. The litterature reports a deterioration of performances in many different cognitive tasks during sleep deprivation [<a href="#R01">1</a>].</p>
<p>In particular, sleep plays an important role for learning and for the memory [<a href="#R02">2</a>,<a href="#R03">3</a>].<br />
What I (briefly) want to focus on here is more specifically the role of <em>dreaming</em> for thoses tasks.</p>
<!-- Dreaming could play a role in memory *consolidation* or memory *reconsolidation*, or both: the distinction between both is unclear. Consolidation is the process by which a memory is stabilized into the long-term memory after its acquisition, while reconsolidation is the process by which memories initialy consolidated are changed with new learning input.   
However, [<a href="#R04">4</a>] states that both may be the same mechanism, as learning something new (= consolidation) must also involve reorganizing previous knowledge (= reconsolidation).   
The distinction is still an area of ongoing research: for a more detailed discussion on that topic, see [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. -->
<p>An idea from F. Crick and G. Mitchison in 1983 is that dreaming is a way for the brain to explicitly <em>unlearn</em> (and not just <em>forget</em>) undesirable information, motivated by the fact that the dreams are remembered only when we wake up in the middle ; and that we need effort in order not to forget it [<a href="#R04">4</a>].</p>
<p>This idea echoes a recent learning algorithm for Artificial Neural Networks developed by G. Hinton: the Forward-Forward Algorithm [<a href="#R05">5</a>].<br />
The common algorithm to make neural networks learn is Backpropagation: the network is fed with some input, and the output is compared to the expected output. The error computed goes backward in the network to update each synapse's weights (i.e. the network parameters) according to the error's derivative in order to minimize it.<br />
However, the signal propagating backward makes this algorithm not biologically plausible: we do not observe anything alike in the brain.</p>
<p>What proposes the Forward-Forward algorithm is to propagate the signal forward, with <em>positive</em> input data, which would typically represent the data we process when awake ; and then propagate the signal forward again, <strong>but</strong> with <em>negative</em> data, which would typically represent the data we create and process when dreaming.</p>
<p>But why would we look for a bio-plausible learning algorithm, when we already have one which is obviously powerful (c.f. ChatGPT and other LLMs)?<br />
Because the brain is a very energy-efficient machine: it consumes only about 20W while training those LLMs required supercomputer for a total energy of 1000kWh, that is, the energy the brain uses in six years [<a href="#R06">6</a>].</p>
<p>However, the theory of unlearning has not proved to be what really happens and other theories exist: more research is needed to better understand our brain.<br />
This is not because a theory may be wrong that brain-inspired computing must not consider it: the power of current AIs relies on an over-simplified model of our neurons and on an invalid learning process. </p>
<p>Who knows, maybe the future AIs will dream of electric sheep?</p>

<h3>2. Spiders</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">Towards earthquake protection of suspended bridges with spiders web</div>
<p>We talked yesterday of taking inspiration of the human brain for computing. But computer science is far from the only field to take inspiration from nature. Indeed, natural structure, materials, and machineries are often the result of millions of years of evolution, which inevitably leads to the most efficient solutions. </p>
<p>Another wonder of the nature are spider webs. They are high-performance structures unmatched anywhere else. For comparison, we define the toughness of a material as the area under its stress (i.e. strength) v.s. strain (i.e. extensibility) curve until it breaks. This quantifies the energy required to snap the material. The silk of the <em>Areneus</em>, a species of spider, has a toughness of 150 MJ.m<sup>-3</sup> versus 25 MJ.m<sup>-3</sup> for carbon fibre [<a href="#R07">7</a>].</p>
<p>The development of such a high-performance silk can be understood as it is the only survival advantage of spiders: they are prone to physical damage, breathe through lungs, constantly need high humidity, are wingless and their legs buckle when overused [<a href="#R08">8</a>].</p>
<p>However, the structure and geometry of spiders web have not been investiguated until 2016, when scientists studied their acoustic properties [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. They show that spider webs could be used to damp low-frequency vibrations, and that tuning their structure allows this property to be fine-tuned.</p>

<figcaption class="no-before">Structure of the spider web investiguated in the paper with its different parameters.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In a crystal, a regular arrangement of atoms, waves cannot propagate freely.
Whereas in the vacuum, all electromagnetic waves (i.e. light) propagate at the same speed, in a crystal, their speed depends on their wavelength: 
\( v = f(\lambda) \). This is the dispersion relation.
</p>
<p>The exact same applies to mechanical waves, such as sound waves, and their speed is a function of their frequency. In particular, it may happen that the speed of a wave is not defined for a range of frequencies. Equivalently, such a wave cannot propagate in the structure and this is called a <em>bandgap</em>.</p>
<p>
By tuning the ratio of stiffness of the circumferential ligaments \( E_\mathrm{cl} \) over that of the radial ligaments \( E_\mathrm{rl} \), they successfully tuned the band gap frequencies:
</p>

<figcaption class="no-before">Bandgaps of the structure as a function of the stiffness of the circumferential ligaments and of the radial ligaments.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They conclude that this study could lead to the development of functional spider-web-structure based materials, for instance to protect suspended bridges from earthquake.</p>

<h3 id="D3">3. Path</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">A quantum particle explores every possible paths simulateneously</div>
<p><em>I dont have much time today, so here are the key points, I will elaborate more this week end, hopefully.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}(x, \dot{x}) \)</span>: basically the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy of a system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Action \( \mathcal{S}[x(t)] \)</span>: the integral of the Lagrangian over time for a given path \( x(t) \).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stationary-action principle</span>: this principle states that classical mechanics always choose the path with a stationary action, i.e. the path with a minimal action.</p>
<figure>
<img style="display: block; width: 100%; border-radius: 5pt;" src="../../media/factober/Least_action_principle.svg" alt="Illustration of different path in green. The only path in red is the one with stationary action: i.e. the classical path" />
<figcaption class="no-before">Illustration of different path a particle could take.<br><span style="font-size: 0.9em">Modified from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Least_action_principle.svg" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Path integral formulation</span>: in the quantum world, we use probabilist tools to describe the objects, and their position. The probability for a particle to be at position \( x_f \) and at time \( t_f \) knowing that it was at \( x_i \) at the time \( t_i \) is written as \(  \langle x_f, t_f | x_i, t_i \rangle \).
Dirac stated that the probability was analogous to \( \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{\hbar} \mathcal{S}[x(t)]} \) [<a href="RXX">X</a>] ; Feynman will show in its thesis that they are proportional [<a href="RXX">X</a>]:
\[ \langle x_f, t_f | x_i, t_i \rangle = \int \mathcal{D}x(t) \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{\hbar} \mathcal{S}[x(t)]}\]
</p>
<p>As a comparison with classical mechanics, where we take only a definite path, in quantum mechanics, we integrate over all possible paths: an interpretation is that the quantum particle explore every possible paths, i.e. not only the red from the previous figure, but also the green ones.</p>
