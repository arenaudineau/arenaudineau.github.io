      <p>Special quantum hardware such as D-Wave‚Äôs quantum annealer has been developed that demonstrates effectiveness in solving targeted problems like Max-SAT and Max Cut (see e.g. [31]). Nurse-scheduling problem and flight gate assignment problem have also been solved in [14] and [24] respectively. Some other interesting problems have been formulated as a QUBO as well. In [22], the problem of estimating the density of states of Boolean satisfiability problem is formulated as a QUBO. On a related front, technology companies have developed fast QUBO solvers (QS) such as Alpha-QUBO [10] (a software solver) and Fujitsu‚Äôs Digital Annealer (DA) [3], a CMOS machine with specialized hardware architecture. These QUBO solvers face several challenges including hardware limitations and no guarantee of solution quality.</p>
<p>Currently, these solvers assume that the given problem is unconstrained, although it has been proven in [18] that a constrained problem such as those stated in a typical integer programming (IP) can be converted to an unconstrained problem using a penalty method [23]. The penalty method achieves this by ensuring that an infeasible solution is not the optimal solution. More details on how to convert a quadratic binary optimization problem with permutation constraints to a QUBO will be covered in the background
section.</p>
<p>In this paper, we focus on permutation-based combinatorial optimization problems, i.e. problems whose constraints are permutation
constraints. For a routing problem (such as TSP), this corresponds to deciding the order of nodes to visit; for a scheduling problem (such as FSP), this corresponds to deciding the order of tasks to be served by a machine. It is known that these problems have dedicated or handcrafted heuristics that perform well: for example for TSP, Concorde [2] is known to be an effective dedicated solver for TSP. For FSP, there are standard heuristics such as the NEH algorithm, such as [19]; while for QAP, various handcrafted meta-heuristics have been proposed (see for example [17]). Heuristics and dedicated solvers may not perform well in specific problem instances, e.g. some hard TSP instances were listed [13], and there is no one-size-fits-all heuristic for QAP benchmark instances.</p>
<p>There are a few challenges that we have to address to use the
solvers effectively. These challenges are</p>
<ul>
<li>The data describing the QUBO varies greatly in magnitude
and a QUBO solver focuses on only certain bits as a result.</li>
<li>Choosing the right penalty coefficient so that we obtain
high-quality solutions.</li>
<li>Solution returned by QUBO solver is not feasible for the
original problem, and</li>
<li>Problem size constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>The research question that we address in this paper is what are
the possible techniques to overcome these challenges. We address
these challenges for permutation-based problems as follows:
We introduce a data scaling technique to control the magnitude
of the data and yet ensuring that the problem is equivalent to the
original problem in Section 3.1. In the penalty method, we have
a penalty parameter ùê¥ in Equation 3 where it plays an important
role in the solution quality. While theoretically, a large ùê¥ ensures
that the resulting QUBO is equivalent to the original problem;
in practice, it is observed that there is a ‚ÄòGoldilocks region‚Äô that
contains penalty values that work well as discussed in [10], if it is
too large, it leads to sub-optimality while if it is too small, it leads
to infeasibility. Hence, we investigate penalty coefficient tuning to
obtain good performance in Section 3.2. Furthermore, the solution
that we obtained from a QUBO solver need not be feasible for
the original problem. We discuss how to compute projection to
ensure that the solution that we obtain is feasible in 3.3. In Figure
1, we present a framework to solve large scale permutation-based
optimization problem.</p>
<p>More precisely, we show in this paper that by incorporating our
techniques, we can enhance the performance of a black-box heuris-
tic QUBO solver that is not guaranteed to solve QUBO instances
optimally. An example is the DA which is based on simulated an-
nealing with a simple bit-flip neighborhood. In order to tackle
large-scale problems that is beyond what the QUBO solver is capa-
ble of solving (due to hardware limitation), a divide-and-conquer
approach can be used to decompose the problem into sub-QUBOs.</p>
